My name is Daniel Fernandez Rico, and I'm a Computer Science student in Madrid. I enjoy both programming and design.
You can find me in the links at the bottom of the page, or [send me an email](mailto:deferrico@gmail.com).


This blog is an experiment to work with Hugo -the website framework-, together with VIM editing, Github Pages and HTML/CSS design.
