# Or how I launched this project ðŸš€

There are several reasons why I started this blog, but the main one is to push my knowledge about web development further, and to work with different technologies I am not very familiar with (*yet*).

I started to build my personal website in **Github Pages** earlier this year. As a personal, non-commercial site, I thought it was the best alternative for hosting. I built it from scratch, with **HTML, CSS and a few JS lines** as I learned web development and UI/UX basics at university this year.

## Hugo.

**Hugo** is, quote, "a website framework developed in **Go** language by [insert spwtv]". It allows you to create a blog with posts written in **markdown**, with several given themes you can customize.

First of all, I love markdown. And I was learning how to use **VIM** as a power user, so I considered this the perfect opportunity to create content and learn at the same time.

## Creation process. 

All the posts are created using **VIM** in **iTerm 2**. Then, **Hugo** uses *blackfriday* [INSERT BLACKFRIDAY] for converting MD posts into HTML, and build the entire website.
Then, the content is pushed using **Github** (or **git**) into my Github Pages repo.

## Making it easier.

I consider Hugo an interesting framework, although the tutorial in their website [INSERT LINK] is not very intuitive. That is why next post will explain all the process to work with Hugo and Github to build a personal blog from scratch.
