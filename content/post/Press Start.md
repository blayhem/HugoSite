# Or how I launched this project ðŸš€

There are several reasons why I started this blog, but the main one is to push my knowledge about web development further, and to work with different technologies I am not very familiar with (*yet*).

I started to build my personal website in **Github Pages** earlier this year. As a personal, non-commercial site, I thought it was the best alternative for hosting. I built it from scratch, with **HTML, CSS and a few JS lines** as I learned web development and UI/UX basics at university this year.

## Hugo.

**Hugo** is, quote, 

>...a general-purpose website framework, (...) a static site generator.

It is developed in **Go** language by [Steve Francia](https://github.com/spf13). 
It allows you to create a blog with posts written in **markdown**, with several given [themes](https://github.com/spf13/hugoThemes) you can customize.

First of all, I love markdown. And I was learning [how to use **VIM** as a power user](https://www.eduonix.com/courses/Software-Development/Learn-VI-and-VIM-the-Free-Text-Editor), so I considered this the perfect opportunity to create content and learn at the same time.

## Creation process. 

All the posts are created using **VIM** in **iTerm 2**. Then, **Hugo** uses [*blackfriday*](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday) for converting MD posts into HTML, and build the entire website.
Then, the content is pushed using **Github** (or **git**) into my Github Pages repo.

## Making it easier.

I consider Hugo an very interesting framework. The [tutorial](https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction) in their website is very exhaustive, although I considerd it a little bit too complex. That is why in the next post will explain all the steps needed to work with Hugo and Github to build a personal blog from scratch.
